**.editorconfig**:  
EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various
editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text
editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily 
readable and they work nicely with version control systems.
**.eslintrc.js:**
ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making 
code more consistent and avoiding bugs. 
**.gitattributes:**
A gitattributes file is a simple text file that gives attributes to pathnames. In this particular repository,
the purpose of the file is to 'automatically normalize line endings for all text-based files'.
**.gitignore:**
A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
**jscsrc:**
JlCSC inter in which WebStorm lets you verify your JavaScript code.
**.travis.yml:**
this file makes use of continuous Integration, which is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently -
rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by
developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.
**CHANGELOG.MD:**
All notable changes to this project are documented in this file,such as bug fixes, new features, etc.
**gulpfile.babel.js:**
Gulp is a tool that helps you out with several tasks when it comes to web development. It's often used to do front end 
tasks like: Spinning up a web server; reloading the browser automatically whenever a file is saved; Optimizing assets 
like CSS, JavaScript, and images. Babel is a transpiler for JavaScript that has the ability to turn ES6 or ES7 into 
code that can run on your browsers and devices.
**LICENSE.txt:**                      
Text file which converys the terms under which the repository is distributed.
**modernizr-config.json:**
Modernizr is a useful JavaScript library to detect user browser capabilities on websites. Command Line Config helps to
automate the process, backed up by a Modernizr NPM module. 
**package.json:**
This file can contain a lot of meta-data about the project. But mostly it will be used for two things:
Managing dependencies of the projectScripts ; Scripts, that helps in generating builds, running tests and other stuff
in regards to the project.
